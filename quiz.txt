1. The meeting event code field is optional. Try setting a value into the field and
see what results when you perform a search (specify a departure and arrival
date before doing this.) How can you handle this field in TSL? (Hint: a clue is
given within the help link associated with this field.)

2. Notice that the Show Best Fares For checkbox and the Fare Class checkbox
are mutually exclusive. How can you use the [property] and [if] features of
the TSL specification language to reflect this?

3. Notice that the “Flexible Dates” box, when checked, exposes two other
toggles. How can you reflect this in the TSL specification?

4. When the Show Price In checkbox is changed from Money to Miles, how does
the form change? How may you reflect this in the TSL?
