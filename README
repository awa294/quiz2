This directory contains materials related to the TSL tool.


If you're on the cse.unl.edu, you should only need the following

README             - this file

tsl-tool-spec.txt  - a document describing this tool, its usage, and
                     its expected input syntax

findspec           - replicates the "FIND" TSL spec from Ostrand & Balcer

findspec.tsl       - output of the tsl tool on "findspec"

tsl                - the tsl executeable, built on cse


you *should* be able to run tsl on the example TSL spec by typing

    tsl findspec

and that should produce a new copy of "findspec.tsl"
(This assumes that your current directory is in your search path for binaries,
else instead of just tsl, use a complete path specification).





If you do need to rebuild tsl, you'll need the following. 


Makefile      - make tsl builds tsl using the following files, with
                object files placed in "objs"

debug.c
defines.h
input.c
main.c
maindefs.h
output.c
structs.h
objs/
